// REST = Representational State Transfer
// REST is an architectural style that defines a set of constraints to be used for creating web services.

// REST is just a convention used to make apis so to make them efficient and easy
// Hence apis following REST are known as Restful apis.

// These api are used to CRUD operations i.e. Create, Read, Update, Delete

// Basically these help us to define endpoints i.e. routs i.e. paths
